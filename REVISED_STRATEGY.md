## Strategic Options

### Option A: Moonshot Portfolio ($66 → 3-4 positions)
**Approach:** Build long-term portfolio of underpriced binary bets

**Target Markets:**
1. **Nick Fuentes President 2045** - Currently 4¢
   - Likely stays < 10¢ for years
   - Max loss: $2-3
   - Potential 10-20x if odds shift

2. **Elon Mars visit** - Currently ~15¢  
   - SpaceX progress could move this 15¢ → 40¢
   - 10-20 year timeframe
   - News-driven volatility

3. **OpenAI vs Anthropic IPO race** - Currently ~60¢ OpenAI
   - IPO window: 2026-2030
   - More near-term than others
   - Tech news drives price

4. **G7 leader exit betting** - Varies by leader
   - Political events drive movement
   - 1-5 year timeframes
   - Definite resolution dates

**Pros:**
- Minimal monitoring needed
- Capital preserving (max loss defined)
- News events = profit opportunities
- Can hold for years if needed

**Cons:**
- No cashflow/trading activity
- Capital tied up long-term
- Low probability of hitting (but high payoff)
- Can't compound gains quickly

**Expected Performance:**
- 1-2 moonshots hit over 2-5 years
- $66 → $200-500 if one 10x's
- Otherwise: slow bleed to $40-50

### Option B: Wait for Better Markets
**Approach:** Park capital, wait for tradeable opportunities

**What to wait for:**
- March Madness (late March 2026)
- Q1 GDP report (late April 2026)
- MLB season (April 2026)
- 2026 midterm elections (Sept-Nov)
- Weather season (tornado, hurricane May-Nov)

**Pros:**
- Don't force bad trades
- Capital preserved for high-edge spots
- Can study/prepare strategies

**Cons:**
- No activity for 1-3 months
- Miss potential moonshot value now
- Risk of missing opportunities

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)
**Approach:** 40% moonshots + 60% cash ready for opportunities

**Allocation:**
- $25 → 3 moonshot positions ($8-10 each)
- $41 → Cash, ready for better markets

**Moonshot picks (Feb 2026):**
1. $10 → Fuentes President 2045 @ 4¢ = 250 contracts
2. $8 → OpenAI IPO before Anthropic @ 60¢ = 13 contracts  
3. $7 → Mars colonization 2050 @ 25¢ = 28 contracts

**Cash deployment triggers:**
- March Madness markets appear
- New economics markets (GDP, jobs)
- High-volume markets with clear edge
- < 90 day timeframes

**Expected Performance:**
- Moonshots: -$5 to +$50 over 1-3 years (low prob, high payoff)
- Cash: Ready for 10-15% CAGR on better markets
- Combined: Preserve capital, stay active
